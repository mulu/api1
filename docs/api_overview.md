# Match Search

## Overview

This api allows searching for matches based on a set of provided criteria. The search critera are provided as query
string parameters to an [HTTP GET](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-9.3) request to the `/v1/matches`
resource. note that since many of the parameter values will contain characters not permitted in query string parameter
values, they must be [url encoded](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.1). Results are returned as a
[JSON](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159) document containing an Array of Objects each representing the presence of a
match between an Offer and a published piece of content.

## Request

Submit an HTTP GET request to `/v1/matches` on the domain provided as part of your account setup. Use the following
